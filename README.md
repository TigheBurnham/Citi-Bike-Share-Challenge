# Citi-Bike-Share-Challenge

## Overview 

The Purpose of this analysis was to learn Tableau and how it's a powerful too that can transform data into an engaging story for a specific audience. In this circumstance we were sent a business proposal for a bike-sharing company based out of Des-Moines Iowa. In order to convince investors, bike-sharing and trip data based out of NYC was used to create the visualizations. 

In this challenge Pandas was used to change the "trip duration" to a date time datatype. Then, the updated data was to create a set of visualizations to show:

- Top Trip Start Locations
- Top Trip End Locations
- Gender Breakdown 
- User Checkout Times
- Gender Checkout Times
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results 

Below are the visualizations that were created to pitch our story to the potential bike-sharing investors.

### Top Start Location
![Top Start Location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112028534/209243721-508400ed-d2ec-41f2-8685-6d3e3320ac61.PNG)

The above image shows the most popular stations in the city for starting a bike journey according to the Citi Bike data. It appears the top starting locations are in Manhattan. 

### Top End Location 
![Top Ending Location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112028534/209243345-af31dbba-4cd1-47af-a392-4d3ea9f3e33c.PNG)

The above visualization answers where riders drop off their bikes after they start their bike journey. Essentially, these are the most popular places to end a bike ride in New York City. It also appears the top ending locations are in similar places as the starting locations.

### Gender Breakdown
![Gender Breakdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112028534/209243351-0405d919-5144-45e6-a63e-83d316226bcc.PNG)

As we can see the majority of the individuals who participate in the bike sharing program are men, and only about 25% appear to be women. 

### Checkout Times for Users
![Checkout Times for Users Viz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112028534/209243370-da27e0ac-c3b0-4c07-b5a5-f70a9b42f913.PNG)

It's clear the majority of bikes are returned within an hour. With the majority of bikes being returned within 20 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender
![Checkout Times by Gender Viz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112028534/209243366-be308cd1-36d7-40e2-9969-08d2a7fb4e60.PNG)

As noted earlier, men are renting more bikes than women, and it also appears they are riding the bikes for a slightly longer duration too. Most women appear to be returning the bikes within 15 minutes of starting their ride.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

Based on the above visual the most popular times to rent bikes are before and after work on the weekdays. Thursday at 5-6pm appears to have the most trips during the week. Wednesday evening appears to have the least amount of trips during the weekdays. This can explain why the start and ending trip locations are the same. Essentially, people are using bike-sharing to commute to and from work.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

Again there is a similar pattern of men renting more bikes before and after work on weekdays. It also appears that women are riding bikes at similar times as men.

### Trips by Gender by Weekday

The majority of individuals that are taking advantage of this service are subscribers who again are men.

## Summary 
Based on the results and visualizations that were created in Tableau it is clear that the target market for the bike sharing program are men who are looking for an alternative form of commute to and from work. Most of the individuals that use this type of service are subscribers, so it appears the ideal subscriber lives within a 15 to 20 minute commute from their office. 

Now this data was from 2019 which is prior to Covid, and is also based off of New York City which is a much different city than Des-Moines. Today more individuals work from home, and based on the traffic and congestion in New York City that may increase the demand for the bike sharing program out of that location. More information regarding the demographics of Des-Moines and how many people commute to work should be collected before this program is pitched to potential investors.
