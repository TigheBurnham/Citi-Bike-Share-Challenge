# Citi-Bike-Share-Challenge

## Overview 

The Purpose of this analysis was to learn Tableau and how it's a powerful too that can to transform data into an engaging story for a specific audience. In this circumsatance we were sent a business proposal for a bike-sharing company based out of Des-Moines Iowa. In order to convnice investors about the opportunity bike sharing and trip data based out of NYC was used to create the visualizations. 

In this challenge Pandas was used to change the "tripduration" to a date time datatype. Then, the updated data was to create a set of visualizations to show:

- Top Trip Start Locations
- Top Trip End Locations
- Gender Breakdown 
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results 

Below are the visualizations that were created to pitch our story to the potential bike sharing investors

### Top Start Location

The above image shows most popular stations in the city for starting a bike journey according to the Citi Bike data. It appears the top starting locations are in Manhattan. 

### Top End Location

The above visualization answers where riders drop off their bikes after they start their bike journey. Essentially, these are the most popular places to end a bike ride in New York City. It also appears the top ending locations are in similar places as the starting locations.

### Gender Breakdown

As we can see the majority of the individuals who particpate in the bike sharing program are men, and only about 25% appear to be women.

## Summary 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset. New York City—Des Moines is quite different! Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
